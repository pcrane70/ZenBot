"If complete and utter chaos was lightning, then he'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting 'All gods are bastards'.",
"What he didn't like about heroes was that they were usually suicidally gloomy when sober and homicidally insane when drunk.",
"The Watch were always careful not to intervene too soon in any brawl where the odds were not heavily stacked in their favour. The job carried a pension, and attracted a cautious, thoughtful kind of man.",
"'It could be worse,' he said by way of farewell. 'It could be me.'",
"That's what's so stupid about the whole magic thing, you know. You spend twenty years learning the spell that makes nude virgins appear in your bedroom, and then you're so poisoned by quicksilver fumes and half-blind from reading old grimoires that you can't remember what happens next.",
"At the back of his mind a bad feeling began to grow. He thought about how it might be to be, say, a fox confronted with an angry sheep. A sheep, moreover, that could afford to employ wolves.",
"Picturesque meant - he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired Twoflower to use the word - that the landscape was horribly precipitous. Quaint, when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-ridden and tumbledown. Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the Discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant 'idiot'.",
"It was all very well going on about pure logic and how the universe was ruled by logic and the harmony of numbers, but the plain fact of the matter was that the Disc was manifestly traversing space on the back of a giant turtle and the gods had a habit of going round to atheists' houses and smashing their windows.",
"'You know, I never imagined there were he-dryads. Not even in an oak tree.'",
"One of the giants grinned at him.",
"Druellae snorted. 'Stupid! Where do you think acorns come from?'",
"What heroes like best is themselves.",
"We've strayed into a zone with a high magical index...",
"'We've strayed into a zone with a high magical index,' he said. 'Don't ask me how. Once upon a time a really powerful magic field must have been generated here, and we're feeling the after-effects.'",
"'Precisely,' said a passing bush.",
"The only reason for walking into the jaws of Death is so's you can steal his gold teeth.",
"'It is forbidden to fight on the Killing Ground,' he said, and paused while he considered the sense of this. 'You know what I mean, anyway...'",
"Ripples of paradox spread out across the sea of causality.",
"He wondered what kind of life it would be, having to keep swimming all the time to stay exactly in the same place. Pretty similar to his own, he decided.",
"I've seen excitement, and I've seen boredom. And boredom was best.",
"Some pirates achieved immortality by great deeds of cruelty or derring-do. Some achieved immortality by amassing great wealth. But the captain had long ago decided that he would, on the whole, prefer to achieve immortality by not dying.",
"It was octarine, the colour of magic. It was alive and glowing and vibrant and it was the undisputed pigment of the imagination, because wherever it appeared it was a sign that mere matter was a servant of the powers of the magical mind. It was enchantment itself.",
"But Rincewind always thought it looked a sort of greenish-purple.",
"I've seen excitement, and I've seen boredom. And boredom was best.",
"'What's this wine — crushed octopus eyeballs?'",
"'Sea grape,' said the old man.",
"'Great,' said Rincewind, and swallowed a glassful. 'Not bad. A bit salty, maybe.'",
"'Sea grape is a kind of small jellyfish,' explained the stranger. '[...] Why has your friend gone that strange colour?'",
"'Culture shock, I imagine,' said Twoflower.",
"'We don't have gods where I come from,' said Twoflower.",
"'You do, you know,' said the Lady. 'Everyone has gods. You just don't think they're gods.'",
"'[...] on the disc, the Gods are not so much worshipped as blamed.'",
"Don’t ask me how I knew—I suppose it was because it was just about the worst possible thing that was likely to happen.",
"A Thaum is the basic unit of magical strength. It has been universally established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon or three normal-sized billiard balls.",
"Pratchett here draws upon the Greek thauma or 'marvel' in creating the name of this basic unit.",
"The sun rose slowly, as if it wasn't sure it was worth all the effort.",
"The pen is mightier than the sword ... if the sword is very short, and the pen is very sharp.",
"The disc, being flat, has no real horizon. Any adventurous sailor who got funny ideas from staring at eggs and oranges for too long and set out for the antipodes soon learned that the reason why distant ships sometimes looked as though they were disappearing over the edge of the world was that they were disappearing over the edge of the world.",
"Of course I'm sane, when trees start talking to me, I don't talk back.",
"Weems might have had a room-temperature IQ, but he knew idiocy when he saw it.",
"Early to rise, early to bed, makes a man healthy, wealthy and dead.",
"'Dead?' said Rincewind, In the debating chamber of his mind a dozen emotions got to their feet and started shouting. Relief was in full spate when Shock cut in on a point of order and then Bewilderment, Terror and Loss started a fight which was ended only when Shame slunk in from next door to see what all the row was about.",
"Darkness isn't the opposite of light, it is simply its absence.",
"Ankh-Morpork!",
"Pearl of cities!",
"This is not a completely accurate description, of course — it was not round and shiny — but even its worst enemies would agree that if you had to liken Ankh-Morpork to anything, then it might as well be a piece of rubbish covered with the diseased secretions of a dying mollusc.",
"The death of the warrior or the old man or the little child, this I understand, and I take away the pain and end the suffering. I do not understand this death-of-the-mind.",
"Here is the blackness of space, the myriad stars gleaming like diamond dust or, as some people would say, like great balls of exploding hydrogen a very long way off. But then, some people would say anything.",
"- 'If you're going to suggest I try dropping twenty feet down a pitch dark tower in the hope of hitting a couple of greasy little steps which might not even still be there, you can forget it,' said Rincewind sharply.",
"- 'There is an alternative, then.'",
"- 'Out with it, man.'",
"- 'You could drop five hundred feet down a pitch black tower and hit stones which certainly are there,' said Twoflower.",
"Radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness, the light fantastic.",
"It was a rather disappointing purple colour.",
"This is a story about magic and where it goes and perhaps more importantly where it comes from and why, although it doesn't pretend to answer all or any of these questions.",
"It may, however, help to explain why Gandalf never got married and why Merlin was a man. Because this is also a story about sex, although probably not in the athletic, tumbling, count-the-legs-and-divide-by-two sense unless the characters get totally beyond the author's control. They might.",
"A world like that, which exists only because the gods enjoy a joke, must be a place where magic can survive. And sex too, of course.",
"It wasn't a large village, and wouldn't have shown up on a map of the mountains. It barely showed up on a map of the village.",
"Time passed, which, basically, is its job.",
"'They're both magic. If you can't learn to ride an elephant, you can at least learn to ride a horse.'",
"'What's an elephant?'",
"'A kind of badger,' said Granny. She hadn't maintained forest-credibility for forty years by ever admitting ignorance.",
"'Do you think I used magic?'",
"Esk looked down at the queen bee. She looked up at the witch.",
"'No,' she said, 'I think you just know a lot about bees.'",
"Granny grinned.",
"'Exactly correct. That’s one form of magic, of course.'",
"'What, just knowing things?'",
"'Knowing things that other people don’t know,' said Granny.",
"'Gods are all right,' said Granny, as they ate their lunch and looked at the view. 'You don’t bother gods, and gods don’t come bothering you.'",
"I'm surely going to regret this, she told herself, displaying considerable foresight.",
"There would be a price. And Granny knew enough about wizardry to be certain that it would be a high one. But if you were worried about the price, then why were you in the shop?",
"They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it is not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.",
"'You mean it's my destiny?' she said at last.",
"Granny shrugged. 'Something like that. Probably. Who knows?'",
"Although his body had been around quite a lot, his mind had never gone further than the inside of his own head.",
"He had the kind of real deep tan that rich people spend ages trying to achieve with expensive holidays and bits of tinfoil, when really all you need to do to obtain one is work your arse off in the open air every day.",
"She liked it because it offered privacy, always appreciated by, as she put it, 'my more discerning clients who prefer to make their very special purchases in an atmosphere of calm where discretion is ever the watchword.'",
"A hint was to Esk what a mosquito bite was to the average rhino because she was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will, half the time, quietly rewrite them so that they don't apply to you.",
"It is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you're attempting can't be done. A person ignorant of the possibility of failure can be a halfbrick in the path of the bicycle of history.",
"One reason for the bustle was that over large parts of the continent other people preferred to make money without working at all, and since the Disc had yet to develop a music recording industry they were forced to fall back on older, more traditional forms of banditry.",
"Wizards parted with money slightly less readily than tigers parted with their teeth.",
"It had been a very long night, and the morning didn’t seem to be an improvement.",
"The Shades, in brief, were an abode of discredited gods and unlicensed thieves, ladies of the night and peddlers in exotic goods, alchemists of the mind and strolling mummers; in short, all the grease on civilization’s axle.",
"Granny had counted the temples with a thoughtful look in her eyes; gods were always demanding that their followers acted other than according to their true natures, and the human fallout this caused made plenty of work for witches.",
"Granny had nothing against fortune-telling provided it was done badly by people with no talent for it.",
"'Can't you read, Esk?'",
"The astonishment in his voice stung her.",
"'I expect so,' she said defiantly. 'I've never tried.'",
"'Hmm. Granpone the White. He's going to be Granpone the Grey if he doesn't take better care of his laundry. Aye tell you, girl, a white magician is just a black magician with a good housekeeper.'",
"'Million-to-one chances,' she said, 'crop up nine times out of ten.'",
"'Who says that?' said Cutangle.",
"'Generally people who are wrong.' said Granny. 'I makes a note in my Almanack, see. I checks. Most things most people believe are wrong.'",
"She told me that if magic gives people what they want, then not using magic can give them what they need."
